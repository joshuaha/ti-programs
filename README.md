# TI Programs

This is a collection of my personal Texas Instruments calculator programs. I'm writing these programs for personal enjoyment, use at your own discretion.

Only tested on my TI-84 Plus. I don't know how this translates to other TI Calculators.

## Available Programs

1. **QUADFORM** - Quadratic Formula (some irrational support)
2. **PNTDIST** - Distance Between Two 2-D Points
3. **ZDEFAULT** - Resets calculator back to default format
4. **FUNCMENU** - Main Program for other programs in this repo

These programs can operate independenly.

**FUNCMENU** Isn't required, just nice to have

**ZDEFAULT** is often used and should be copied over with other programs

_Note: This will reset most of the format menu to default settings_
